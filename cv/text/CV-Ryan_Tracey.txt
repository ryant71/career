  Interesting Projects:

  * ChessCube  (Subcontracted via CatalytIQ Pty Ltd)
               Assisted ChessCube (http://www.chesscube.com/) build a 
               database of 3 million played chess games. The resultant
               data set included just less than 1 billion rows of data 
               spread across 8 database tables. The project involved 
               processing games (stored in PGN format) in batches
               so as not to slow the game engine down and then stitching
               the resultant data sets together so that relational 
               integrity was retained. We have also advised ChessCube
               on database specific matters over the past few years. 
               We utilised MySQL, MyISAM and Merge tables, as well as 
               Linux, Perl, and IBM's JRE to accomplish the tasks. 

  * 24.com     (Subcontracted via CatalytIQ Pty Ltd)
               We built the bulk of 24.com's travel site (gotravel24.com).
               The project was intensive as 24.com was under pressure to 
               launch and integrate the site with a partner company within 
               3 months of us being awarded the contract. We used the Linux,
               Apache, MySQL, PHP stack along with Drupal to accomplish the
               task. I was effectively the project lead and had to manage 
               the project at the technical level. The complexities in the 
               project included integrating Drupal with the following 
               24.com services:
                - 24.com single-sign-on system (HTTP,cookies)
                - weather24.com portal (XML/Python)
                - search24 portal (XML/Python)
                - 24.com's newsletter/mailing list system (HTTP/SMTP)
               In addition, the site had to integrate with Comair and a UK
               -based company (RWA) via their SOAP interfaces.
               The website also had to conform to 24.com's look-and-feel and
               couldn't look like it was built on Drupal. 
               The project was significant for 24.com because it was the first
               time they had: utilised the LAMP stack and Drupal; used the 
               Scrum methodology; and outsourced the development of such a 
               large project. Although it was stressful at times I thoroughly
               enjoyed working on the gotravel24.com project.

  * Old Mutual (Subcontracted via CatalytIQ Pty Ltd)
               Catalytiq was initially contracted to Old Mutual to assist
               them in understanding how impending commission legislation 
               changes would impact their brokers. The project involved 
               processing large sets of data and building projections 
               based on the new regulations. Eventually it was decided to
               build a website application (CommWiz) through which each broker
               could view models specific to their own history and data. 
               Catalytiq's Direct (Andy Baxter) provided Perl scripts and
               MySQL stored procedures to process the data and build the 
               predictions. I assisted with the data processing and general
               systems administration of the MySQL and Apache servers. The
               website application was developed by a PHP developer 
               contracted in to Catalytiq and who we had worked with before
               on the 24.com project.
               The new commission regulations came into effect in January 2009
               and CommWiz has, since then, evolved into a general purpose
               tool for brokers.

  * Praekelt   (Subcontracted via CatalytIQ Pty Ltd)
               Concurrent with working on the Old Mutual project I have been
               contracting to Praekelt (via Catalytiq) and providing systems
               administration services. This involved setting up virtualisation
               using Linux KVM on a number of hosts and building Linux virtual
               hosts for the various Praekelt web apps which are based on the
               Nginx/FastCGI/Django/MySQL stack. Each virtual host is monitored
               using Monit and has its web logs processed by AWStats. These
               and other systems are automatically installed using the Fabric
               deployment system.

  Period:                      September 2002 - December 2005
  Position:                    Senior Systems & Security Engineer
  Company:                     Thawte
  Technologies:                Apache, Python, MySQL, J2EE, JBOSS
  Responsibilities:
  * Maintained 99.99% uptime of the production web, app, and database servers.
  * Maintained Test and Pilot environment (daily database cleansing and 
    builds.)
  * Liaised with Verisign's security team during their frequent vulnerability
    scans of Thawte networks and implemented the few security updates they 
    could find.
  * Applied security patches, including custom built kernels.
  * Production (web/database) environment design:
    * Throughput testing: web and app to database
    * Network layout
    * SMTP routing
    * DNS forwarding
    * NTP
  * MySQL master/slave replication via SSL Secure Tunnel to:
    - Disaster recovery location
    - Local office for use in data warehouse and for test data.
  * Following customer or code induced database mishaps I have also identified
    missing or bogus data and taken corrective measures including data restor-
    ation from backups and transaction logs, and archival-and-deletion of 
    redundant data.
  * LDAP lookups of valid recipients from Exim mail gateway to the MS Exchange
    Server in order to reduce load on both mail systems.
  * Use of Exiscan on the Exim 4 mail gateway to integrate Exim ACLs with
    Spamassassin and an Anti-Virus package.
  * Wrote and maintained various Python CGI scripts for user management in the
    production system.
  * Built Disaster Recovery Servers in the DR location. This included
    testing that the new servers were fully remotely managable, that they
    were configured with the correct timezone, were using NTP correctly, 
    were using using the correct DNS servers, were relaying email via the 
    correct SMTP "smarthost", that the Python code environment had been
    updated with the new servers details, and confirmed that the new database
    server was slaving off the master database in the production environment.
    At that time I worked with the network team to re-configure the routing
    of server's back-end network configs and confirmed that they were 
    managable on their backend interfaces.
  * Wrote Python CGI scripts that allows QA staff to perform the following 
    functions on test and pilot systems without relying on administrators:
    * logtail     - a web based Apache/JBOSS log viewing tool which used
                    regular expressions to determine where error tracebacks
                    began and ended and presented each error block in its own
                    HTML table cell for easier viewing. 
    * upload      - a web based upload tool which allowed QA staff to upload
                    existing code builds to the test and pilot servers without
                    any intervention from system administrators.  QA staff
                    had estimated that the time-saving was around 100 minutes
                    per day.
    * others      - other web based extensions to the above scripts allow
                    QA staff to stop and start processes, touch files in 
                    the JBOSS deploy directory (causing JBOSS to re-deploy)
  * I configured the MTAs on all test and pilot servers to redirect system 
    generated emails to a central server where they are fed into a web-based 
    archiver called Lurker. QA staff use this system and Lurker to confirm that
    our code is generating customer destined emails correctly.  The MTA setup
    also prevents testing and pilot emails from accidentally reaching real 
    customers.
  * In addition to general MySQL performance tuning I have also, at times,
    analysed the SQL within code to find potentially inefficient SQL queries. 
  * I have written shell scripts to automate the regular build of test and 
    pilot databases with fresh data.  This includs masking any sensitive data
    and altering specific data-sets to allow for easier testing by the QA 
    staff.
  * Wrote Python scripts to fetch data over SSL (using Client Authentication
    with SSL certificate) in CSV format and enter into a local MySQL database.
    This provided Sales with new leads provided by another department.

Projects / Achievements


  Period:                  June 2005
  Project/Achievement:     Survived the Sober.O worm outbreak.
  Technologies:            Exim 4 MTA (Mail Transfer Agent)
  Responsibilities:
  * It appeared that the Sober.O worm intentionally or otherwise targeted
    thawte.com email addresses with the result that the company's MTA was
    deluged with emails generated by infected PCs all around the world.
    Over a period of days our Exim 4 MTA rejected millions of Sober.O emails
    and remained operational largely due to it being configured to follow
    SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) very strictly.  The use of strict
    policies ultimately stopped those worm laden emails from reaching our
    internal MS Exchange server and infecting the corporate network
    - taking into consideration the fact that most Anti Virus vendors took
    up to 6 hours to respond to Sober.O. The policy of strict compliance
    with the SMTP RFCs mitigated against a very real threat to business
    continuity.



  Period:                  December 2004
  Project/Achievement:     Performance Enhancements
  Technologies:            MySQL
  Responsibilities:
  * In December 2004 / January 2005 I upgraded the database software from
    MySQL 3.23.x to MySQL 4.0.x.  Prior activities included extensive testing
    and rollback planning. This was achieved with no interruption to the
    business, nor on the business reporting tools that rely on database
    replication. Archiving older data and restructuring data tables further
    improved database performance.



  Period:                  2003
  Project/Achievement:     Database Replication for Performance and Data
                           Redundancy
  Technologies:            MySQL, SecureTunnel
  Responsibilities:
  * With the addition of a hot-standby Disaster Recovery site it became
    necessary to replicate data to that site in a timely manner.   Master-slave
    replication was investigated, tested (on the recently implemented test
    environment), and approved for implementation.   I configured three servers
    to slave off of the master database (by then, in Mountainview, California):
      - a spare server in the same data centre as the master,
      - a server in the Disaster Recovery location,
      - and a server in Cape Town
    Where the connectivity between slave and master crossed the Internet I
    encrypted the sessions using an SSL tunneling tool called 'stunnel'.
    I also had to manually configure the Linux routing tables to accommodate
    multiple SSL tunnels.  The master/slave replication effectively replaced
    the multistage backup and restore process previously implemented.  A
    replication monitoring system (with email-to-sms notification) was
    implemented in Python.  For increased performance, front-end servers that
    perform read-only data queries use the slave server nearest the master
    database in the production network.



  Period:                  August 2002
  Project/Achievement:     Web Server Farm
  Technologies:            Apache, MySQL, Firewalls,
  Responsibilities:
  * Designed, tested, and implemented a server farm for Thawte.  This included
    testing database performance, installing Linux on the servers (with a
    colleague at a data center in Virginia, USA), setting up Apache and MySQL
    and the base production environment.  Each server ran a custom Linux kernel
    with firewall support built in.



  Period:                  2000 - 2002
  Project/Achievement:     Database Backup and Restore System
  Technologies:            MySQL, Python, BASH
  Responsibilities:
  * I had inherited a system where the Thawte production database (Genuity Data
