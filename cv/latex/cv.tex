\italicgray{The Mobility House is a young and dynamic technology company whose goal is to drive on the transition to the use of sustainable energy sources.}
\end{minipage}
Working at The Mobility House has, thus far, afforded me the opportunity of\\ &working on a variety of projects - delivering value through the use of AWS tools such as CloudFormation, Elastic Container Service (Fargate), and others. Full continuous delivery involves GitHub, CircleCI, Docker, CloudFormation, and Fargate. Further tools in the stack include SaltStack, RabbitMQ, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Prometheus, and Grafana (deployed with CloudFormation on ECS Fargate with an RDS backend.) Recently, I have been made team-lead for the Infrastructure \& DevOps team.\\\\\\

\end{minipage}
Working at wiGroup allowed me to expand my skills from systems administration to DevOps engineering and to migrate a terrestrial architecture to a cloud-base one. Ultimately, I became the competency lead for the DevOps team. In more detail, the technologies I used and the roles I performed were:
\begin{itemize}[topsep=6pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item MySQL - administration, replication, stored procedures, trouble-shooting
\item AWS data services such as RDS, Data Migration Service, Data Pipeline, and RedShift
\item General AWS technologies
\item Python scripts to interact with PagerDuty, Slack, PushBullet, and bespoke REST and SOAP APIs
\item Python/SQLAlchemy for ETL
\item Contribute to the architectural design of DevOps solutions
\item Manage the standardisation of tools and processes used to achieve DevOps
\item Management oversight of root cause analysis for pre-production and production environments
\item Partner with cross functional teams to execute short and long term product delivery strategies
\item Manage Amazon Web Services including configuration and deployment of required 
infrastructure, administrative tasks, and budgeting
\item Ensuring application deployments to AWS and Data Centres are performed reliably and repeatedly through the use of advanced scripting and tools
\end{itemize}\\
&\begin{itemize}[topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item Contributing to the DevOps team's configuration and deployment toolkit - e.g. Ansible, Fabric, and CloudFormation
\item Ensuring optimal application performance and functional monitoring as well as upgrade management
\item Testing of Software services (e.g. APIs with SoapUI/Postman) and infrastructure during deployment
\item Ensures the client solution build, deployment and enhancements are delivered on time and to specification both within the initial release and in all subsequent releases
\item Working closely with Project Managers, Solution Architects, Testers, Analysts, and Developers
\end{itemize}\\\\
